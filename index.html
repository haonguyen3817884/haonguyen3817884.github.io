								        	<p><strong>Background Information:</strong> I was born in Vietnam. I’m 22 year old and I did study in another university before I came here. However, I haven’t finished it so currently I’m still a highschool postgraduate and trying to achieve the bachelor of information technology. I can speak two languages. The first one is my mother tongue and the second one is english. </p>
										<p><strong>A fact about me:</strong> I have a very strange hobby. Unlike other young people, I often spend most of my free time reading comics instead of using social media like Facebook or watching Youtube. Every day, after finishing homework, I often read about 3 - 4 comic books. Most of them are kids comics like one piece or doraemon. Interestingly, even though all of them are now on the internet, I still love reading them on paper. </p>

								<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
								<p>I started developing an interest in IT when I accidentally watched a video on Youtube which show why children should learn about coding. This video showed that learning code is not too difficult as I thought it was. Since that, I began looking for more information about IT like how IT jobs would be like or what inside IT courses. Surprisingly, the more I read about it, the more I found that it fits my personality.</p>

								<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
								<p>There are two reasons I chose RMIT to study IT. High quality teacher is the first reason. RMIT is one of the most expensive universities in Vietnam. It means that the school can pay for well-qualified teachers who have experience of teaching and working on IT field. The final reason is that RMIT provides an international environment. Not only Vietnameses, but a lot of students from other countries like Korea or Australia also study in RMIT. Using english as the main language allows all students from different countries to speak and work together.</p>

								<h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
								<p>An understanding of computers and programming languages are two important things that I want to learn during this course. Understanding of computers means that I have to know basic knowledge of computers like how they store data and how they process it. Programming languages refers to common languages like java, C++ or Ruby. it means that I want to learn how to master those languages to build programs.</p>

							<h1>Job Description</h1>
							<p>Front-end development focus on designing the website. The front-end developers will be responsible for the three main things which are writing code, fixing bugs and optimizing the web performance. For writing code, the developers will collaborate with designers to get ideas and write codes to display them on the website. It’s interesting for me because I do not have to be so creative to develop the website, I just need to follow ideas from designers and create what they want. For fixing bugs, the developers will read the current codes and find areas that need to improve. I may not be so creative but I’m a very careful person. I used to spend hours looking for mistakes in my work. Therefore, checking and fixing will be my favorite job.</p>						
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12 animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft">
							<p></p>
							<h1>The skills, qualifications, and experience required</h1>
							<p>This position requires a bachelor’s degree, knowledge of both front-end languages, problem-solving skills and having experience. A bachelor’s degree means I must graduate with a bachelor of information technology. For front-end languages, I have to master programming languages like HTML/CSS. For Problem-solving skills, it involves identifying the problems and developing solutions for them. Having experience means that I used to have at least 2 year of working as a front-end developer.</p>

From the online learning test, I know that visual and auditory are my best learning styles. Not only that, it also helps me recognize what I should improve if I want to work in IT industry. According to the results from the myers-briggs test, I often let my emotions take control of myself. However, most IT jobs require highly critical thinking skills. Therefore, I need to learn how to control my emotions and avoid making decisions based on feelings.</p>

							<p>In my opinion, the results highly affect how I behave while working with others. Take the results of the myers-briggs test as an example, it showed that I’m an introvert who is always comfortable with being alone so when I work in a team, I will avoid suggesting ideas or participating in a debate.</p>

								        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project is about making a virtual online investment platform.The website allows people to invest their money virtually. The purpose of this project is to let people have a chance to practice analyzing the financial information and investing. This project contains two parts ( IT part and financial part ). The IT part involves creating and maintaining the website. This includes coding, debugging and optimizing. The financial part involves collecting financial data and forming financial formulas. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> There are several reasons why this project will be very useful. Firstly, it helps young people develop a good habit. According to many articles, a lot of young students today do not have a habit of saving money. They always spend money on unnecessary things like new shoes. This is mainly because they do not find any reasons to save their money or they do not know what benefits saved money will bring to them. Therefore, having such websites is needed. By earning profit from investments they will have more reasons to save their money. Secondly, it is a safe place for financial students to practice what they learn. Investing in real financial markets may be too risky for many students. Therefore, using virtual money to invest will keep them safe from making wrong decisions. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Description(1):</strong> This website will function as real online investment platforms. Firstly, there will be a variety of financial markets on the website. Not only the stock market, it also provides other common financial markets like foreign exchange or gold market. therefore, Investors will have more choices to invest. They will be able to choose one or many markets at the same time. Secondly, the user account will work as real banking accounts. It will store all the personal information as well as the financial information privately. All the profit or loss from investment will also be recorded and added into customer’s account. Thirdly, virtual money but real experience. All the financial information on the website like the stock price or the company’s name are taken exactly the same from real financial markets. This will make customer’s experience on the web more realistic. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Description(2):</strong> Not only that, It is also a good place to learn and practice financial analysis. Firstly, there will be a place for users to make financial analysis. A platform will be added to help them create their own analysis. This platform will have a form of notebook and the record of the analysis will last until the users delete it. Secondly, it is easy to do simple financial analysis on the website. For those who are new to the financial world, finding information as well as formulas to make analysis can be very difficult. There are a lot of information and formulas to collect. To make it more convenient, all the information and basic financial formulas are fully provided on the website. Besides, learning basic financial formulas will be easier. For each formula, there is always a paragraph below to explain the meaning of it. The website also includes funny exercises to help people who have not studied finance before to get used to reading and analyzing financial information. Finally, financial students can perform complex analysis or expand their current analysis. The website will have a platform to store financial data and it will update new financial information. Students can use them to keep updating their analysis. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Tools and Techonologies:</strong> To make this project work, personal computers, financial software and mainframe computers are required. Personal Computers are used to create and manage the website by using programming languages like HTML, PHP or Java. Financial software refers to two types of software ( financial management and financial calculation ). Financial management software allows the website to do accounting functions like tracking the budget, recording transactions and organizing investment portfolios. Financial calculation software helps the website perform calculations based on financial formulas to let the user measure the profit or loss of investment. A mainframe is a big computer which manages the database. It is mostly used to maintain the website by storing and transferring both financial and user data. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Skills Required:</strong> There are a few skills required to implement this project successfully. One of the most important skills that need to be obtained at first is problem-solving skills. In order to turn this project idea into reality, there will be a lot of problems that need to be dealt with. Therefore, the better you are good at this skill, the better project implementation will be. The next important requirement is mastering front-end programming languages like HTML or Java. these languages will help you create the website and make applications on this. Having knowledge of finance is also required when you do this project. In order to build the financial software, you must have a deep understanding of financial data and formulas to write codes. The final requirement is an in-depth knowledge of back-end programming languages like MySQL or Python. It is so important because mastering those languages will help you manage the database system. </p> 
									<p></p>
									<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If this website is really created, it will bring benefits for both education and financial industry. For education, it provides a new way for financial students to learn practical knowledge. Instead of practicing by doing exercises in class, they can create an account on the website and use virtual money to learn investing. For financial industry, a new method of checking analysis will be created. By making analysis to do investing on this website, investors can check whether their analysis is right or not. </p>
